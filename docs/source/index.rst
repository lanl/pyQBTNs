Welcome to pyQBTNs's documentation!
===================================

pyQBTNs is a Python library for boolean matrix and tensor factorization using D-Wave quantum annealers. The library includes five different boolean tensor decomposition methods making up three distinct types of tensor networks. The methodologies for pyQBTNs are described in :cite:p:`pelofske2021boolean` and :cite:p:`Daniel2020`. 

pyQBTNs includes five different boolean tensor factorization methods, making up three distinct types of tensor networks. pyQBTNs allows the user to specify local solvers that do not require a connection to a quantum annealer, but still solve the optimization problems the annealer would solve in the factorization algorithm.

In order to use a D-Wave quantum annealer as the solver for this software, the user must set up a D-Wave configuration file. The tensor methods allow for multi-rank factorization, but the current implementation only allows single rank factorization (i.e. one rank used across the entire algorithm)

Installation
========================================
**Option 1: Install using pip**

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git+https://github.com/lanl/pyQBTNs.git

**Option 2: Install from source**

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/lanl/pyQBTNs.git
    cd pyQBTNs
    conda create --name pyQBTNs python=3.7.3
    source activate pyQBTNs
    python setup.py install

Setup and Verify D-Wave connection
========================================
1. `Install pyQBTNs <#installation>`_
2. Sign up with `D-Wave Leap <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/>`_ (Make sure that you have at least 1 minute of QPU time on your free acccount).
3. Set up `D-Wave config file <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html>`_ (You can use either an **Advantage** system or a **2000Q** system, but NOT a **Hybrid** solver).
4. Run an example:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd tests
    python -m unittest TestMatrixFactorizationQuantum.py

.. note::

    For more detailed description of the D-Wave setup process see the `tutorials <https://github.com/lanl/pyQBTNs/tree/main/tutorials>`_ or the `example notebook on D-Wave <https://github.com/MaksimEkin/pyQBTNs/blob/main/examples/D-Wave_matrix_factorization.ipynb>`_.


Example Usage
========================================
.. code-block:: python

    from pyQBTNs import QBTNs
    import numpy as np

    qbtns = QBTNs(factorization_method="Matrix_Factorization", solver_method="classical-simulated-annealing")

    p = 0.7 ### Bernoulli boolean density parameter
    N1 = 10 ### Dimension 1
    N2 = 10 ### Dimension 2
    RANK = 3 ### Factorization rank

    np.random.seed(42)
    A = np.random.choice(a=[False, True], size=(N1, RANK), p=[p, 1-p])
    B = np.random.choice(a=[False, True], size=(RANK, N2), p=[p, 1-p])
    X = np.matmul(A, B)

    print("A =", A)
    print("B =", B)
    print("X =", X)

    print("X dimensions =", X.shape)

    qbtns.fit(X, RANK)

    print("Hamming distance =", qbtns.get_score())

    A_prime, B_prime = qbtns.get_factors()
    print("A_prime =", A_prime)
    print("B_prime =", B_prime)

    print("Reconstructed Matrix =", qbtns.get_reconstructed_tensor())
