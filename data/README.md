## Data for reproducibility

`test_tensors/` contains boolean tensors in `.npy` format.

`factorization_results/` contains the results from factoring the test boolean tensors. The results include the computation time used (i.e. QPU time in the case of using the quantum annealer backend), as well as the computed factors of the tensor.
